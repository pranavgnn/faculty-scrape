### Hosted [here](https://faculty-scrape.vercel.app/)!

Wanted to spend some time learning web scraping using Python and BeautifulSoup, ended up learning a little bit of web development too! win-win.

* scraper.py - scrapes the faculty list from the [official website](https://manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty.html) using python and BeautifulSoup.
* server.py - handles the backend of the webapp.
* templates - HTML renders. I used bootstrap for styling

Learnt the tools and built the application from scratch in under 8 hours!

I definitely need to revisit this and do a huge rework.
